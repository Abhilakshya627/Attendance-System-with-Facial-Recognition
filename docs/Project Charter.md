# Smart Attendance System Using Face Detection from Group Images

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop an automated smart attendance system that marks student attendance by detecting individual faces from a single group photograph captured in a classroom environment. The system is designed to function reliably in crowded classrooms, varying lighting conditions, and heterogeneous camera qualities typically found in teachers’ personal mobile devices.

## Problem Statement
Traditional attendance methods are time-consuming and inefficient, especially in large or combined classes where the number of students can exceed 100–200. Manual attendance marking also introduces human error and consumes valuable instructional time. An automated system capable of detecting and identifying students from a single image can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy.

## Objectives
- Detect and extract all visible student faces from a single group image
- Ensure extremely high recall to avoid missing any student
- Support crowded classroom scenarios with overlapping and small faces
- Build a scalable foundation for future face recognition and attendance marking

## Scope
### Included in Current Phase
- Group image ingestion
- Face detection and extraction (Task-1)
- Dataset preparation and model training

### Excluded in Current Phase
- Face recognition and identity matching
- Attendance database integration
- Teacher-facing user interface

## Constraints
- Images captured using personal mobile phones with varying camera quality
- Variable lighting and classroom layouts
- High face density and occlusions
- Limited computational resources in early deployment

## Stakeholders
- Teachers
- Educational institutions
- System administrators
- Development team
